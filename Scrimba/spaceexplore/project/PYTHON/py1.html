            <h2>History and Evolution</h2>
            <p class="history">Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and released in 1991. It aimed to be an easy-to-read and versatile language, with early features like exception handling and functions. Python 2.0, introduced in 2000, added new capabilities such as list comprehensions and garbage collection.</p>

            <p class="history">In 2008, Python 3.0 was released with significant changes that improved language consistency and functionality but were not backward compatible with Python 2.x. As of 2020, Python 2 has reached its end-of-life, and Python 3 remains the focus of development, praised for its readability, flexibility, and extensive libraries.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Python</h2>
            <ul>
